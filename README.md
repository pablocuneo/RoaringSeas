# RoaringSeas
Game Made in Global Game Jam 17

Pirates are storming Neptune's castle in this first-person shouter game! Use your voice to raise the level of the waves and prevent the attacking ships from reaching your castle. Be careful, though! If you’re too loud, you’ll create a tsunami that will destroy everything, including the castle!

Controls:
Make noise into your computer's microphone to control the level of the waves.
Bigger ships require bigger waves (and thus louder noises) to destroy.
However, be careful not to destroy friendly ships bringing supplies to restore the castle.
And if you're too loud, you'll cause a tsunami to destroy everything.

Requirements:
OS: Windows XP SP2+, Mac OS X 10.8+
Graphics card: DX9 (shader model 3.0) or DX11 with feature level 9.3 capabilities.
CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
Microphone
